# Mahsa_food
this app is based on Mvp architecture and has several concepts as adapter,room database ....
it is a test app that you can add,update or delet foods by clicking or long clicking on them.you can also search a particular food in the searchbar located on the top of the screen which is not case sensitive!
the other thing that makes this project more beautiful is whenever you scroll the page you face with different colers for each card and the color is not as same as last scroll.
gradiant shaps which are used as background make the project 2x beautiful.
